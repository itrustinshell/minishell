Minishell
It is a UNIX program.
This program interprets the command that users type on terminal.

Flow:
user enter a command
shell takes comand and sends it to the kernel

Parts of a shell:
- parser
- executor
- shell subsystems

Parser:
- takes command line
- parser remove \n (it is overwritten with \0)
- splits it into tokens
Example:
ls -l *.c
is seen like this:
	l,s,\0,-,l,\0,*,.,c,\0
it means that it is an array of strings:
	{"ls", "-l", "*.c"}
